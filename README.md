# My Obsidian CSS Snippets

## About

My stash for CSS snippets I've used to customize [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), my go-to note-taking app.

### [WYSIWIG-like.css](https://github.com/frankreporting/obsidian-snippets/blob/main/WYSIWYG-like.css)

This one gives you a WYSIWIG-like interface directly in the edit view, as opposed to having to switch to preview mode. It makes Obsidian behave a little more like [Typora](https://typora.io) â€” in this case, your markdown becomes invisible and is replaced with rendered HTML on all but the active line. This is basically a mod and mashup of Santi Younger's [Org-sidian-Bullets](https://github.com/santiyounger/Org-sidian-Bullets) and the WYSIWYG option in Ozan Tellioglu's [Ozan's Image in Editor plugin](https://github.com/ozntel/oz-image-in-editor-obsidian), so major thanks and shoutouts to both!

### [minimal-theme-link-fix.css](https://github.com/frankreporting/obsidian-snippets/blob/main/minimal-theme-link-fix.css)

If you use Stephan Ango's [Minimal Theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal), then this simply flips the script on what text to emphasize in your hyperlinks, highlighting the linked text and muting the URL string, more in line with the rendered HTML. Originally had it in my WYSIWYG CSS snippet but it seemed better not to muddle things with theme-specific tweaks.
